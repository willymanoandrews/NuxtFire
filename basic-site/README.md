### Prerequisites

Before you can start with this boilerplate, make sure you have the following installed and configured:

### 1. Node.js & npm
Ensure that you have Node.js (version 14.x or higher) and npm installed.
To check if they are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash

# Basic Site Template

This directory contains a simple 5-page website template built using Nuxt 3. It includes the following pages:
- Home
- About
- Services
- Projects
- Contact

This template is ideal for creating a basic website with minimal setup and ready-to-use pages. It also integrates Flowbite's Tailwind CSS components for a clean and responsive design.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the basic site template:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the main repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:willymanoandrews/NuxtFireProd.git
```

### 2. Copy the `basic-site` Directory
Navigate into the project and copy the `basic-site` directory into a new directory where you'd like to start your project:

```bash
cp -r basic-site <your-new-directory-name>
cd <your-new-directory-name>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your website will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Start Coding!
Feel free to customize the code to fit your needs. The basic structure is set up for you, and you can start building your site by modifying the components, pages, and styles as required.
