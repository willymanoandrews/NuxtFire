# Auth Payment Template

This directory contains an authentication and payment template using Nuxt 3 and Firebase. It provides user sign-up, login functionality, and payment integration with Stripe. This template also includes middleware protection for premium content and examples of Stripe integration for subscription and one-time payments.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the auth-payment template:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the main repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:willymanoandrews/NuxtFireProd.git
```

### 2. Copy the `auth-payment` Directory
Navigate into the project and copy the `auth-payment` directory into a new directory where you'd like to start your project:

```bash
cp -r auth-payment <your-new-directory-name>
cd <your-new-directory-name>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Create an .env File
Create a new `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your Firebase and Stripe project details. These include your Stripe API keys, webhook signing secret, and Firebase configuration.

### 5. Initialize Firebase in the Project Directory
If you haven't already installed Firebase tools, follow these steps to initialize Firebase in your project directory:

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```
2. **Login to Firebase** (if not already logged in):
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase Functions** (if not already logged in):
   ```bash
   firebase init functions
   ```
When prompted:
- Select your Firebase project.
- Choose Python for the functions runtime.
- Do not install dependencies yet (you'll do this later).

### 6. Navigate to Functions Directory and Install Dependencies
Once Firebase initialization is complete:
- Navigate to the 'functions' directory:

```bash
cd functions
```

- Copy/paste the `requirements.txt` and `main.py` into the `functions` directory.
- On macOS or Linux: Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows: Run the following command:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- After the installation, test your functions locally using Firebase Emulators:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

- After starting the emulators retrieve your functions URL:

```bash
âœ” functions[us-central1-create_subscription]: http function initialized (http://127.0.0.1:5001/your-project/us-central1/create_subscription)
```

- Use the Stripe CLI to test your webhook function. For example, use the following command to forward events to your webhook URL:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:5001/your-project/us-central1/stripe_webhook
```

- Create an `.env` file in the functions directory using your Stripe API key (testing) and the webhook signing secret obtained from the Stripe CLI.

- Example `.env` content:

```bash
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_api_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_signing_secret
```

- Initiliaze Firebase Emulators:

```bash
firebase init emulators
```

- When prompted, select `Auth` and `Firestore` emulators
- Use the default ports for the emulators.
- Enable the Emulator UI and download the emulators if prompted:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

- Ensure that the emulators are running properly before proceeding. You should see the local services initialized and ready for use.

- Once the emulators are running correctly, install the Firebase extension to send emails from Firestore. This will allow you to automatically send emails when triggered by events:

```bash
firebase ext:install firebase/firestore-send-email@0.1.34
```

Follow the prompts to configure the extension:

1. Grant the necessary roles for the extension to send emails.
2. Enter your SMTP URI details (you will need this information from your email provider).
3. Choose where to store the secret (e.g., local file or a secure environment).
4. Enter the SMTP password when prompted.
5. Set the default Firestore collection to store email data (keep it as the default `mail` collection unless you want a custom one).
6. Enter the default "from" email address (this will be the sender of your outgoing emails).
7. Optionally, configure TTL (Time-to-Live) if needed to automatically delete documents after a set time.
8. Choose default values or customize the extension configuration as needed.

### 7. Test the Firebase Extension

After configuring the extension, test that it's working by triggering an email send from Firestore. Add a document to the Firestore `mail` collection and ensure the email is sent through your SMTP server.

### 8. Add Your .env File

Add your working `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided. This file should be placed in the root directory of your Nuxt project, separate from the `.env` file used for Firebase functions.


### 9. Run the Development Server

Make sure your Firebase emulators are still running. Then, run the Nuxt 3 development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Your application should now be running locally, and you can test user sign-up, login, payment flows, and email notifications.

### 10. Test and Code

Verify that all authentication and payment flows are working as expected. Check that emails are sent when appropriate (e.g., after a successful payment).

From here, you can customize the code and start building your project!
